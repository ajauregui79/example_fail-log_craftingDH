# Week 2 Blog Post
# Sunrise on Methodology and Radical Transparency of Sources in Historical Writing
The author talks about this concept of sharing and checking facts. Foot notes and verifying the truth.
Would historians change the way they do things and use apps like Zotero so people can check facts? I think the author promotes the idea.

# Open Notebook History
The author promotes the idea of making notes public and compares this to open source software. 
I think this would be great to improve the way things happen now. Historians may hoard information that sometimes is never public. Therefore why not share it as it happens
Crowdsourcing is a great way to keep thigns going and faster.
