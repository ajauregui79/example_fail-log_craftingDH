# Week 1 fail log
I have had much trouble getting started. Although I am somewhat techy, I have had trouble understanding how to set things up. I set up GitHub, DH Box (and the vpn to be on Carleton's newtwork) and Hypothesis.

Not the best start and I am late at doing all of this but I am trying hard to keep up. Hopefully I will catch up soon.
