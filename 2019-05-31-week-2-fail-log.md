# Week 2 fail log
I have been doing the readings and started my annotations.

# Annotation 1
My first annotation is about checking facts, and how it is a lot easier to check facts with the help of the internet. It helps find fake information and credit or discredit (if the case may be) articles and information. However, it is also a tedious process that will not always be done.

# Annotation 2
Open Source for software and for Open Source History. I added a comment on collaboration. My point of view is that Collaboration and crowdsourcing is great, but it is important to take into account what the gain from each party that collaborates may be. https://hyp.is/R6bwkndtEem2fsP48MI3cw/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html

# Annotation 3
Sharing information is a wonderful thing. Historians should share their information as they have it ready. Although easier said than done, I still think information should be shared. I understand how complicated it can be to share something and ensure that no one else will take ownership of one's work, however I think with the proper available tools, it is possible. https://hyp.is/gN2M4oO0Eem2n39U92Emcg/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html

# Conclusion
Two important things come out of the Lectures, the importance of the veracity of what is being published, especially now with the internet as a tool available to everyone. And that the information should be shared, as long as it can be copyright protected.
