# Week 2 fail log
I have been doing the readings and started my annotations.

# Annotation 1
My first annotation is about checking facts, and how it is a lot easier to check facts with the help of the internet. It helps find fake information and credit or discredit (if the case may be) articles and informatin. However, it is also a tedious process that will not always be done.
