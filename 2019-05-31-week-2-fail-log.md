# Week 2 fail log
I have been doing the readings and started my annotations.

# Annotation 1
My first annotation is about checking facts, and how it is a lot easier to check facts with the help of the internet. It helps find fake information and credit or discredit (if the case may be) articles and informatin. However, it is also a tedious process that will not always be done.

# Annotation 2
Open Source for software and for Open Source History. I added a comment on collaboration. My point of view is that Collaboration and crowdsourcing is great, but it is important to take into account what the gain from each party that collaborates may be. https://hyp.is/R6bwkndtEem2fsP48MI3cw/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html
